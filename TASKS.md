# Javelin build checklist

This file is the central hub's master checklist. A checked item requires evidence.
Implementation threads own one PR each and keep their own checklist in their worktree.

## Definition of done

Javelin reaches GA when a developer can install a released build, create a project,
use ordinary tools in isolated Layers, recover history, and collaborate through
hosted Publish Requests. The supported platforms, recovery behavior, concurrency,
and installation paths must have reproducible verification. Public documentation
must describe the actual product and its limits. No runtime, storage, test, or user
workflow may invoke or interpret Git.

## Bootstrap the build

- [x] Recover the accepted design from the final and earlier grilling threads.
- [x] Confirm that earlier code may be replaced rather than preserved.
- [x] Open and link the hub's draft planning PR: [#3](https://github.com/Dhruv2mars/javelin/pull/3).
- [x] Record the accepted product contract and milestone verification gates in `docs/build-contract.md`.
- [x] Persist the latest working instructions in `AGENTS.md` and `RTK.md`.
- [ ] Launch one local-core thread and one filesystem-verification thread.
- [ ] Record their thread, branch, PR, and evidence links here.
- [ ] Arrange persistent hub continuation without duplicating active work.
- [ ] Independently review this plan against the accepted design.

## Prove the local VCS

- [ ] Define native objects, World versions, Layers, checkpoints, and atomic Publish.
- [ ] Implement initialization, durable immutable snapshots, history, and restore.
- [ ] Prove ordinary filesystem behavior for sparse isolated Layers.
- [ ] Implement Layer creation, cloning, checkpointing, discard, status, and diff.
- [ ] Implement Stack, refresh, structural conflicts, and explicit resolution.
- [ ] Bind supplied agent traces to immutable work, with missing-trace override.
- [ ] Prove process concurrency, crash recovery, retries, and corruption detection.
- [ ] Build a real sample application using external agents and Javelin exclusively.
- [ ] Verify the complete workflow on each supported operating system.

## Prove hosting and collaboration

- [ ] Define the versioned provider-independent repository protocol.
- [ ] Implement repository authority, immutable transfers, and idempotent Publish.
- [ ] Provision one repository on the first provider with a simple creation flow.
- [ ] Implement identity, scoped credentials, applied permissions, and revocation.
- [ ] Implement author-owned immutable Publish Request revisions and exact approvals.
- [ ] Implement browser review, comments, checks, direct Publish, and reviewed Publish.
- [ ] Implement clone and independent forks with permitted inherited history.
- [ ] Verify public upstream contribution without requiring a hosted fork.
- [ ] Verify control-plane outage behavior and provider-outage local work.
- [ ] Resolve CI execution design and verify the accepted workflow syntax.
- [ ] Measure hot-repository contention, many repositories, transfer costs, and quotas.

## Deliver OSS GA

- [ ] Verify installation and upgrades from clean machines on supported platforms.
- [ ] Publish tutorials, command reference, hosting setup, and recovery documentation.
- [ ] Add contribution guidance, support policy, security reporting, and license checks.
- [ ] Complete independent security and correctness review, fixing material findings.
- [ ] Set measured release limits and performance requirements before claiming scale.
- [ ] Run the full local and hosted acceptance suite against release artifacts.
- [ ] Publish versioned packages and release artifacts with checksums and provenance.
- [ ] Verify the public release as a new developer and record GA evidence.

## Current work

The hub owns branch `chore/ga-build-plan` and [PR #3](https://github.com/Dhruv2mars/javelin/pull/3).
The initial implementation workstreams will start from this branch's recorded contract.
PRs are never merged without explicit user instruction.

## Open engineering questions

- Native filesystem backends and their host prerequisites require direct verification.
- Storage layout and provider partitioning remain implementation choices.
- Numerical performance claims and adequate provider free-tier capacity are unproven.
- CI execution, release credentials, and infrastructure access remain to be established.
